- Amount (decimal, 2 decimal places)
- Currency (ISO 4217 code)
- Payment method (card, PayPal, Apple Pay)
- Customer ID (UUID)
- Order ID (alphanumeric)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given a customer has a valid credit card
When they submit an order for $99.99 USD
Then the system shall authorize $99.99 on their card
And return an authorization ID within 3 seconds
And reserve the funds for 7 days
```

**FR-PAY-002**: The system shall validate payment methods before authorization:
- Card number checksum (Luhn algorithm)
- Expiration date (must be future date)
- CVV (3-4 digits)
- Billing ZIP code

**FR-PAY-003**: The system shall implement 3D Secure (3DS) for transactions:
- EU transactions >€30
- Flagged high-risk transactions
- Customer-requested authentication

**FR-PAY-004**: The system shall return authorization results:
- **Success**: Authorization ID, authorized amount, expiration timestamp
- **Failure**: Error code, user-friendly message, retry flag

#### 3.1.3 Test Cases

| Test ID | Scenario | Expected Result |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| TC-PAY-001 | Valid card, sufficient funds | Authorization approved |
| TC-PAY-002 | Invalid card number (Luhn check fail) | Authorization rejected, error code INVALID_CARD |
| TC-PAY-003 | Expired card | Authorization rejected, error code EXPIRED_CARD |
| TC-PAY-004 | Insufficient funds | Authorization declined, error code INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS |
| TC-PAY-005 | 3DS required, customer completes auth | Authorization approved after 3DS |
| TC-PAY-006 | 3DS required, customer cancels | Authorization rejected, error code 3DS_FAILED |
