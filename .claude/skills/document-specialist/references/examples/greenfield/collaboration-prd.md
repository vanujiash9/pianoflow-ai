## Objective

Build a **real-time collaboration platform** that enables distributed teams to work together seamlessly through shared workspaces, live document editing, video conferencing, and integrated task management.

**Problem**: Remote teams struggle with fragmented tools (Slack for chat, Google Docs for documents, Zoom for video, Asana for tasks), leading to context switching and reduced productivity.

**Solution**: An all-in-one platform that combines communication, collaboration, and coordination in a unified workspace.
