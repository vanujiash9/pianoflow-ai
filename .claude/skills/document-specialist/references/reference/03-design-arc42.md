## 3.1 The arc42 Template

arc42 is a practical, modular template for documenting architecture. It provides a 12-section table of contents that answers the most important questions:

### The 12 Sections

1. **Introduction and Goals**: Key requirements, stakeholders, top quality goals
2. **Constraints**: Non-negotiable business, technical, or legal decisions
3. **Context and Scope**: System boundaries and external interfaces
4. **Solution Strategy**: High-level design choices and rationale
5. **Building Block View**: Static decomposition into modules/components
6. **Runtime View**: Dynamic behavior for key use cases
7. **Deployment View**: Physical/cloud infrastructure
8. **Crosscutting Concepts**: Logging, error handling, security patterns
9. **Architectural Decisions**: ADRs (what, why, alternatives, trade-offs)
10. **Quality Requirements**: Detailed quality scenarios
11. **Risks and Technical Debt**: Known issues and compromises
12. **Glossary**: Authoritative term definitions

### Integration with C4

arc42 sections map naturally to C4 diagrams:

| arc42 Section | C4 Diagram Level |
|---------------|------------------|
| Section 3: Context and Scope | C4 Level 1: System Context |
| Section 5: Building Block View | C4 Level 2: Container, Level 3: Component |
| Section 6: Runtime View | Sequence diagrams, Activity diagrams |
| Section 7: Deployment View | Deployment diagrams |

### When to Use arc42

**Use arc42 when:**
- Building complex systems requiring comprehensive architecture docs
- Working in regulated industries (finance, healthcare)
- Onboarding new architects or teams
- Conducting architecture reviews

**Skip arc42 when:**
- Building simple CRUD applications
- Creating proof-of-concept or MVPs
- Working on small microservices (use lightweight SDD instead)
