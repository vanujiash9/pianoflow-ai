## 4.2 State Machine vs. Activity Diagram

### State Machine Diagram

**Purpose**: Model the **states** of a single object and **event-driven transitions**

**Focus**: Object behavior based on its current state

**Key Elements**: States (circles), Events (triggers), Transitions (arrows)

**Use When**: System behavior changes based on state (e.g., Order: Pending → Processing → Shipped)

**Example: Task Lifecycle**
```plantuml
@startuml
[*] --> Pending
Pending --> InProgress : assign_user
InProgress --> InReview : submit_for_review
InReview --> Completed : approve
InReview --> InProgress : reject
Completed --> [*]
@enduml
```

**Characteristics:**
- Event-driven (waits for events to trigger transitions)
- Models a single object's lifecycle
- Shows what states are valid and invalid transitions

### Activity Diagram

**Purpose**: Model **workflows, processes, or algorithms**

**Focus**: Flow of activities with decisions and parallelism

**Key Elements**: Activities (rectangles), Decisions (diamonds), Forks/Joins (bars)

**Use When**: Showing business processes with parallel steps (e.g., user registration flow)

**Example: Task Creation Workflow**
```plantuml
@startuml
start
:User clicks "New Task";
:Enter task details;
:Validate input;
if (Valid?) then (yes)
  :Save to database;
  fork
    :Send email notification;
  fork again
    :Update analytics;
  end fork
  :Display success message;
else (no)
  :Display error message;
endif
stop
@enduml
```

**Characteristics:**
- Action-driven (flows automatically from step to step)
- Models processes or algorithms
- Shows parallel execution with forks/joins

### Key Difference

**State diagrams wait for events; activity diagrams flow automatically.**

| Question | State Machine | Activity Diagram |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Am I modeling an object's lifecycle? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Does behavior depend on current state? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
