## 6.2 Deployment Diagrams

**UML Deployment Diagram:**
- Shows physical infrastructure
- Maps software to hardware
- Displays network topology

### Example (PlantUML)

```plantuml
@startuml
node "Load Balancer" as lb {
  artifact "Nginx"
}

node "Application Server 1" as app1 {
  artifact "API Service" as api1
}

node "Application Server 2" as app2 {
  artifact "API Service" as api2
}

database "PostgreSQL" as db {
  artifact "Primary DB"
}

database "Redis" as cache {
  artifact "Cache"
}

cloud "AWS S3" as s3 {
  artifact "File Storage"
}

lb --> app1 : HTTP/HTTPS
lb --> app2 : HTTP/HTTPS
app1 --> db : PostgreSQL Protocol
app2 --> db : PostgreSQL Protocol
app1 --> cache : Redis Protocol
app2 --> cache : Redis Protocol
app1 --> s3 : S3 API
app2 --> s3 : S3 API

### What to Show

**Infrastructure Nodes:**
- Servers (physical or virtual)
- Containers (Docker, Kubernetes pods)
- Databases
- Caches
- Message queues
- Load balancers
- CDNs
- Cloud services (S3, SQS, etc.)

**Connections:**
- Protocols (HTTP, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Ports (8080, 5432, 6379)
- Security (TLS/SSL)

**Deployment Units:**
- Artifacts (JARs, Docker images)
- Configuration files
- Static assets

### Use Cases

**Use deployment diagrams for:**
1. **Onboarding**: Help new engineers understand infrastructure
2. **Incident Response**: Visualize dependencies during outages
3. **Capacity Planning**: Identify bottlenecks and scaling opportunities
4. **Security Reviews**: Show attack surface and trust boundaries
5. **Compliance**: Document data flows for audits
