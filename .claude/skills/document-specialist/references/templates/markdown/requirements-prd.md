## 🚫 5. Out of Scope (For This Release)

To maintain focus and hit our timeline, the following are explicitly **out of scope** for v[X.Y]:

- [Feature/capability 1: e.g., Mobile app support (planned for v2.0)]
- [Feature/capability 2: e.g., Integration with third-party tools]
- [Feature/capability 3: e.g., Advanced reporting and analytics]

**Future Considerations**: [Brief note about what might come next]

## 🔧 6. Technical Considerations

### Architecture Impact
[Brief description of how this fits into existing architecture]

**New Components:**
- [Component 1: e.g., Task assignment service]
- [Component 2: e.g., Notification queue]

**Modified Components:**
- [Component 1: e.g., User service needs to track task assignments]

### API Changes
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/tasks` - Create task
  - `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{id}/assign` - Assign task
- **Modified Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` - Now includes assigned tasks count

### Database Changes
- **New Tables**: `tasks`, `task_assignments`
- **Modified Tables**: `users` (add `task_quota` field)

### Third-Party Integrations
- [Integration 1: e.g., Email service for notifications]
- [Integration 2: e.g., Calendar API for due date reminders]

### Performance Considerations
- [Consideration 1: e.g., Task list queries should use pagination (limit 50 per page)]
- [Consideration 2: e.g., Caching strategy for frequently accessed tasks]

### Security & Privacy
- [Consideration 1: e.g., Task visibility respects project-level permissions]
- [Consideration 2: e.g., Audit log for all task assignments and changes]

## 🤔 11. Open Questions & Decisions

### Open Questions
- [ ] **Q1**: Should tasks be private or visible to all project members?
  - **Status**: ⏳ Pending decision
  - **Owner**: @PM
  - **Due Date**: [Date]

- [ ] **Q2**: What is the maximum number of tasks a user can be assigned at once?
  - **Status**: ⏳ Pending decision
  - **Owner**: @TechLead
  - **Due Date**: [Date]

### Key Decisions Made
- ✅ **D1**: Tasks will support single assignee only (no co-assignees in v1.0)
  - **Decision Date**: [Date]
  - **Rationale**: Simplifies initial implementation; can add in v2.0 based on user feedback

- ✅ **D2**: Task due dates are optional
  - **Decision Date**: [Date]
  - **Rationale**: Not all tasks have deadlines; forcing a date creates bad data
