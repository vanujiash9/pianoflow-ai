## Pre-Flight Checks

**STOP**: Do NOT proceed unless ALL checks pass.

### Check 1: Verify System Health

# Verify recent backup
aws rds describe-db-snapshots \
  --db-instance-identifier production-db \
  --query "DBSnapshots[0].[DBSnapshotIdentifier,SnapshotCreateTime]" \
  --output table
```

---

### Step 2: [Second Major Action]

**What this does**: [Explanation]

**Manual steps** (if not automated):
1. Navigate to [location]
2. Click [button/menu]
3. Confirm [action]

**Or use automation** (recommended):
```bash
./scripts/[automation-script].sh $ENVIRONMENT
```

**Expected output**:
```
[Output from script or UI confirmation]
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] [Check 1]
- [ ] [Check 2]
- [ ] [Check 3]

---

### Step 3: [Continue Pattern for Each Step]

[Repeat structure: What it does → Commands → Expected output → Verification]

---

## Verification & Success Criteria

### Post-Execution Checks

#### Check 1: Application Health
```bash
# Test application endpoints
curl -s https://api.company.com/health
curl -s https://api.company.com/metrics
```

**Success criteria**:
- HTTP 200 status
- Response time <200ms
- No errors in logs for 5 minutes

---

#### Check 2: Metrics Validation
**Monitor these dashboards**:
- **Error Rate**: https://grafana.company.com/d/errors (should be <0.1%)
- **Latency**: https://grafana.company.com/d/latency (P95 <500ms)
- **Throughput**: https://grafana.company.com/d/throughput (baseline ±10%)

**Watch for 10 minutes** before declaring success.

---

#### Check 3: [Additional Verification]
[Specific checks for this runbook]

---

## Rollback Procedure

### When to Rollback

Execute rollback immediately if ANY of these occur:
- ⚠️ Error rate exceeds 5%
- ⚠️ P95 latency >2x baseline for 5 minutes
- ⚠️ Critical functionality broken
- ⚠️ [Specific failure condition]

### Rollback Steps

#### Step 1: Stop Current Process
```bash
# Immediately halt any ongoing changes
[stop-command]
```

#### Step 2: Restore Previous State
```bash
# Revert to last known good configuration
[rollback-command]

# Example for Kubernetes deployment:
kubectl rollout undo deployment/[app-name] -n production
```

**Expected output**:
```
[Rollback success message]
```

#### Step 3: Verify Restoration
```bash
# Confirm system returned to previous state
[verification-command]
```

**Success criteria**:
- Metrics return to baseline
- No increase in error rate
- Application responding normally

#### Step 4: Notify Stakeholders
- Update incident ticket with rollback status
- Notify in [#channel]
- Schedule post-mortem

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: [Common Problem]

**Symptoms**:
- [What you see/experience]

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Commands to diagnose
[diagnostic-command]
```

**Root Cause**:

## Automation

### Automated Steps
This runbook includes automation for:
- [Step X]: Automated via [script/tool]
- [Step Y]: Automated via [CI/CD pipeline]

### Script Locations
- Main script: `scripts/[runbook-name].sh`
- Helper scripts: `scripts/lib/[helpers].sh`
- Configuration: `config/[environment].yaml`

**Run automation**:
```bash
# Full automation (requires approval for production)
./scripts/[runbook-name].sh --env=production --auto-approve

# Dry run (safe, shows what would execute)
./scripts/[runbook-name].sh --env=production --dry-run
```

### Manual Fallback
If automation fails, follow manual steps in [Step-by-Step Procedure](#step-by-step-procedure).
