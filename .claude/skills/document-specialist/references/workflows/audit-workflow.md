| "arc42", "Architecture" | SDD | Design documentation |
| "openapi:", "paths:" | OpenAPI | API specification |
| "How to", "Step-by-step" | User Docs | End-user guides |

### Step 2: Run Quality Checklist

| **Critical** | Missing mandatory section, incorrect information |
| **High** | Incomplete coverage of important topic |
| **Medium** | Formatting, consistency issues |
| **Low** | Minor improvements, recommendations |

### Step 4: Generate Audit Report

```markdown
# Documentation Audit Report

**Document**: [name and path]
**Type**: [SRS|PRD|SDD|OpenAPI]
**Audit Date**: [date]

## Executive Summary
- **Quality**: [Excellent|Good|Fair|Poor]
- **Completeness**: [percentage]
- **Recommendation**: [Approve|Minor Revisions|Major Revisions]

## Critical Issues
[List with location, issue, impact, recommendation]

## High Priority Issues
[List with details]

## Quick Wins (< 1 hour)
[List of easy fixes]

## Next Steps
1. Fix critical issues
2. Address high priority items
3. Implement improvements
```

### Step 5: Present Fix Options

Present summary and options to user:
